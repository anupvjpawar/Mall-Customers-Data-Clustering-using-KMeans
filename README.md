# Mall-Customers-Data-Clustering-using-KMeans



Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering
Shopping Complex

Malls and shopping complexes leverage machine learning to enhance customer targeting and increase efficiency. This project explores the application of K-Means Clustering to segment customers based on their Annual Income and Spending Score.

Dataset
The project uses a dataset containing customer information, including CustomerID, Genre, Age, Annual Income (k$), and Spending Score (1-100).

Key Steps:
Data Cleaning and Exploration: Load the dataset, handle duplicates, and explore data statistics.
Descriptive Statistics: Analyze and visualize the distribution of key features like Age, Annual Income, and Spending Score.
Gender Distribution: Visualize the gender distribution using a count plot.
Customer Segmentation: Apply K-Means Clustering to segment customers based on Annual Income and Spending Score.
Optimal Cluster Selection: Determine the optimal number of clusters using the Elbow Method.
Visualize Segmentation: Visualize customer segmentation and cluster centers.


Usage:
Clone the repository.
Ensure you have the required dependencies installed (pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, scikit-learn).
Run the Jupyter notebook or script.
Feel free to customize, extend, or apply this project to other datasets for similar analyses!
